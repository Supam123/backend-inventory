### [Click me Client is on Netlify](https://crudclient.netlify.app/)
### [Click me Server Backend is on Heroku](https://shop-project76.herokuapp.com/posts)

### You may open client and server in two tabs and perform crud on client and you will be able to verify the changes on the server by hitting refresh button on  the browser.

### Open the server on Heroku first and then the Client on Netlify :)
